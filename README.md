### The lectures for the Spring 2023 version of Stanford University's course CS193p (Developing Applications for iOS using SwiftUI) were given in person but, unfortunately, were not video recorded.  However, we did capture the laptop screen of the presentations and demos as well as the associated audio.  You can watch these screen captures using the links below.  You'll also find links to supporting material that was distributed to students during the quarter (homework, demo code, etc.).
